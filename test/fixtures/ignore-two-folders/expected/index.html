<p>There now is your in­su­lar city of the <a href="http://www.mobydickthewhale.com/moby-dick/word/manhattoes.htm">Man­hat­toes</a>, belted round by wharves as In­dian isles by coral reefs—com­merce sur­rounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you wa­ter­ward. Its ex­treme down­town is the bat­tery, where that no­ble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours pre­vi­ous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of wa­ter-gaz­ers there.</p>
